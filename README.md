# Network
Neural Network training and running c/c++ 

**Build Instructions**
Make sure you have:

- A C++ compiler (e.g. MinGW on Windows)
  
- [OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/) installed
  
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) headers for PNG loading
  
- You can build the project using Code::Blocks or a standard Makefile with OpenBLAS linked.

**Training**
Training is performed over a set number of epochs with options for:

- Batch size
  
- Learning rate
  
- Regularization factor
  
- Early stopping (WIP)

**Note**
there's a couple of previously trained networks by me in folder Trained Dudes
